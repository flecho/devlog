This is a simple blog that records my development log.

After reading this article,

](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf),
I have decided to get my hands dirty to create my own blog. 
This blog will record all my personal noteworthy logs in markdown format.
